DYNAMIC PARTITIONING OF SOCIAL NETWORKS (thesis)
Link: https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/42231/Mindi_Yuan.pdf?sequence=1
Small summary: Make use of the algorithm in our paper for analysing social networks. Hereby get the edges a weight based on chat frequency and access recency. In combination of the algorithm the social network is analysed.

STREAMING HYPERGRAPH PARTITION FOR MASSIVE GRAPHS (thesis)
Link: https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=kent1385097649&disposition=inline
Small summary: A solution for the same problem but then for hyper graphs.

Efficient processing of streaming graphs for evolution-aware clustering
Link: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2505750 (not yet have read the PDF)
Small summary: Describes another clustering algorithm. This is different algorithm than in our paper that clusters in a snapshot at a single timestep. In this algorithm if an edge is removed, then it is still taken into account for the clustering.
